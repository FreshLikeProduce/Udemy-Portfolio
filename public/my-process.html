NOT CONTENT, DO NOT INCLUDE IN SITE, JUST PROCESS NOTES

NOTE- This site will eventually be put live on the internet as my portfolio!

Started by taking of screenshots of my projects so far, per the video.

Then I deleted the existing code in the birthday and movie pages, also per the video, 
and replaced them with the code from my prior projects.

PROGRESS NOTE - I may still go back and edit the projects to better reflect my own tastes,
such as different photos/text/etc (or just to appeal to different tastes). They will not match 
the original code of the projects.

I also created this My-Process page so I can keep a record of how I created this
and spot my own mistakes (hopefully minimal)

I am making sure to keep in mind the importance of nesting as that was heavily noted
as probably the most important skill for building HTML websites.

Creating the boilerplate in the index.html file.

I chose to type out the boilerplate as practice. I kept wide spaces between the major
parts of it to keep myself oriented, while making sure indentation was clean.

Reminders:
Head = Not visible to users, just rendering info (meta/titles/etc)
Body = Visible to users, the content itself

Starting up after a few days of not working on this, brushing up my memory. I'm currently doing
some easy stuff, like editing the contents of the Contents and About pages. I plan on also 
revamping the Birthday Project with new photos or even linking shows to IMDB pages or where to 
watch them, but I'll save that for later, I want to work on the structure a bit now so I don't forget much.

Adding ANCHOR ELEMENTS first, HTML links to the project html pages. I peeked at the solution to see just
how much detail was included - I made to to include height and an alt tag like the solution for consistency.
First I did it for the TV rankings, then copy + pasted and changed the targets for the birthday invite project.

Then, I added About Me and Contact Links to the bottom. I included lines and paragraphs per my own style choices.

I finally looked at the preview after all this and the links and photos were sharing a line with each
other if the screen was wide enough. I added a < br / > in between each to keep them on their own lines.

Then I replaced the birthday party photo, and included photos for each of the TV shows on my ranking list,
similar to how the Birthday Project was formatted (it looked too simple). I also replaced the sample screenshots.

Initially, I had a separate link to the pages above the images, but I want to make it so the image itself is a
link (idk yet if I'll keep the original links too so they're both clickable). I know I did that at some point,
just need to remember when... I think I can guess it, I'll try that first, I think I can just change the href
from text to an img, so we'll see. (I WAS RIGHT! Came out exactly how I wanted, decided not to keep the text 
hyperlink but just the plain text title bc the hyperlink blue was so ugly.)

Did a quick run-through, here are the errors so far:
- The google maps link on the bday invite just linked back to the bday invite.
- I accidentally overwrote my BBQ Birthday image with the screenshot of the project itself,
that was just a lil goof, easy to fix.
- OTHERWISE ALL GOOD! This was actually really easy, and even though I made a few errors,
they were all easy to diagnose and correct, I'm excited about this course, I can tell it's 
well-designed with great teaching principles in mind. Also patting myself on the back for being
more realistic about pacing. Need to keep this in mind as things get more difficult so I can 
withstand the discouragement of a plateau.
