<h2>My top 3 TV shows of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Sailor Moon</h3>

<p>This is my favourite anime. It's trendsetting and was wildly progressive for its time. It's not perfect, but its impact is undeniable.</p>
<h3>Supernatural</h3>

<p>While there's a lot of debate on the quality of this show, I find you can watch it as lightly or as seriously as you want, making it very rewatchable!</p>
<h3>The Witcher</h3>

<p>Similar depth as Game of Thrones but the scale is a bit cosmic. It's a very adult version of She-Ra:Princesses of Power, in terms of the concept of cosmic beings coming to dominate the world (at least centuries after the fact).</p>
